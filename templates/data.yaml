  statement: >
    Much of my research focuses on how the physiology of an organism shapes its behavior in response to environmental
    change. My research encompasses nutritional and metabolic physiology, quantitative ecology, and foraging behavior.

research:
  statement: >
    <p>To date, my work has focused on marine mammals in Alaskan ecosystems and has attempted to explore how changes
    in the prey field might be impacting pinniped (seals and sea lions) populations from a metabolic perspective.</p>
    <p>To assess these types of questions I use a variety of quantitative methods, including nonparametric analysis, 
    such as PERMANOVA, linear discriminant analysis (LDA), and non-metric multidimensional scaling (NMDS), as well as
    regression analyses like GLM/GLMM and GAM/GAMM, as well as machine learning techniques such as random forest
    analysis.</p>

      statement: >
        <p>My work in nutritional physiology focuses on the examination of blubber fatty acid profiles of Alaskan 
        harbor seals and Steller sea lions. Because blubber fatty acids are largely derived from diet in these animals,
        we are able to use them as a proxy for diet and examine how they differ and change over time. In this study, I
        was able to use two large multi-decadal data sets to examine (1) <a href="https://doi.org/10.1093/conphys/coab0
        36" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">spatial and temporal differences in blubber fatty acid profiles
        of Alaskan harbor seal populations</a>, (2) <a href="https://doi.org/10.1578/AM.48.4.2022.362" target="_blank"
        rel="noopener noreferrer">examine blubber fatty acid profiles among pregnant and lactating harbor seals, and
        mother pup pairs</a>, and lastly, (3) compare regional and seasonal blubber fatty acid profiles of Alaskan
        harbor seals and Steller sea lions to examine the degree of prey partitioning between these species. As a
        sentinel species in Alaska, the ability to survey blubber fatty acids of harbor seals provides a way to not
        only monitor diet changes that could lead to population level impacts, but also provides a means to oversee
        prey community changes and ecosystem health within the regions they inhabit. This work is a collaboration
        between <a href="https://www.baylor.edu/biology/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Baylor University
        </a> and <a href="https://www.adfg.alaska.gov/index.cfm?adfg=home.main" target="_blank" rel="noopener

      header: Respiratory Physiology
      statement: >
        <p>My work in respiratory physiology focused on how sea lions physiologically respond to increased foraging 
        stress caused by changes in their prey field. In this study we determined that while sea lions are able to
        adjust their dive behavior to maintain foraging efficiency as the cost of foraging increases, their ability to
        sequester accumulating carbon dioxide diminishes. We proposed that carbon dioxide may be a more sensitive
        physiological marker than oxygen when examining the metabolic cost of foraging. This project was a
        collaboration between <a href="https://www.alaskapacific.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">
        Alaska Pacific University</a> and <a href="https://animaltraining.us/physiology/" target="_blank" rel="noopener
