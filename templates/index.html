                        Much of my research focuses on how the physiology of an organism changes and adapts to changes in its environment. 
                        My research interests include nutritional and metabolic physiology, quantitative ecology, and foraging behavior.

                    <p>
                        To date, my work has focused on marine mammals in Alaskan ecosystems and has
                        attempted to explore how changes in the prey field might be impacting pinniped (seals and sea lions)
                        populations from both a metabolic perspective, as well as a nutritional and digestive standpoint.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        To assess these types of questions I use a variety of quantitative methods, including
                        nonparametric analysis, such as PERMANOVA, linear discriminant analysis
                        (LDA), and non-metric multidimensional scaling (NMDS), as well as regression
                        analyses like GLM, GAM, GLMM, and GAMM, as well as machine learning techniques
                        such as random forest analysis.

                            <p>
                                My Masters research was a collaboration with Moss Landing Marine Laboratories
                                examining how sea lions physiologically respond to increased foraging stress
                                caused by changes in their prey field. In this study we determined that while sea
                                lions are able to adjust their dive behavior to maintain foraging efficiency as the
                                cost of foraging increases, their ability to sequester accumulating carbon dioxide
                                diminishes. We proposed that carbon dioxide may be a more sensitive
                                physiological marker than oxygen when examining the metabolic cost of foraging.

                            <p>
                                My dissertation research was a collaboration with Alaska Department of Fish and
                                Game focused on the examination of blubber fatty acids of Alaskan harbor seals
                                and Steller sea lions  and included two large multi-decadal data sets. With these
                                data sets I was able to investigate regional, seasonal, and age class differences
                                in blubber fatty acids of harbor seals, as well as examine the blubber fatty acids
                                of lactating harbor seals, and how they differ to non-lactating harbor seals and
                                other lactating phocids and otariids. I was also able to compare blubber fatty
                                acids of Alaskan harbor seal and Steller sea lions in the same regions during the
                                same spatial and temporal timeframes to determine if differences in foraging
                                strategies were reflected in their blubber fatty acid profiles. Because both
                                mammal species are resident species to the areas they inhabit and are easier to
                                study than fish or invertebrate species in the area due to their size, they are seen
                                as health indicators for the ecosystems they inhabit. Understanding how their diet
                                is changing gives management agencies insight into how the fish and
                                invertebrate communities are changing, providing an indirect way to measure
                                ecosystem health.
